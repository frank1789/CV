\opening{Dear Hiring Manager}
I am Francesco Argentieri, express my interest in Simulation Development Engineer role advertised on your site. I got Mechatronic Engineering (M.Eng.) in March 2020 and qualified as an Industrial Engineer (24 July 2020 - I session - Italian Law)

Since June 2020, I have worked for Kineton as a software embedded developer.
My primary task is to develop Infotainment for a lightweightâ€™s full-electric micro-car.
I gained experience in programming C++ and Qt regarding high-performance software. On the other hand, I also, am comfortable with interpreted languages such ad python for scripting and automation.

During my university career, I developed projects both in groups and individually.
I have acquired skills in design and modelling with Ansys, to conduct both static and dynamic simulations with FEM techniques. Furthermore,
I acquired a good knowledge of Matlab. Also, I got experience with symbolic manipulation software such as Maple.
In particular, the last one presents functionality close to commercial software Dymola.

I am looking for new challenges and the possibility of applying my knowledge to the world of motorsport.
I would invite you to view a short reel about the projects: \href{https://vimeo.com/414217599}{https://vimeo.com/414217599}, \href{https://vimeo.com/421445895}{https://vimeo.com/421445895} and my \href{https://github.com/frank1789}{GitHub page}.

   Kind Regards\\
