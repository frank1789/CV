\opening{Dear Hiring Manager}

I am writing to you to express interest in .
I recently graduated in M.Sc in mechatronic engineering and got already a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

During my university career I have always developed projects both in groups and individually.

I acquired skills in the use of design and modeling in suites like Ansys. I have matured experience in programming C++, Python and also package such as using Matlab and its advanced use integrated with other software.
I also have a good knowledge of symbolic manipulation software such as Maple. 

Although I lack experience, I have developed a critical thinking, the ability to analyze and to propose the best solution as well as the ability to work in a team. 
I offer my skills and my desire to start working, experimenting and growing professionally.\\

\\Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{
   Yours Sincerely\\
   Francesco Argentieri}
