The first part was compare the component with variable thickness, verify its response to static stresses respect a previous study where the same component had constant thickness.  The second part of the work was characterized by research a method to interface and study the molding's result simulated in Ls-Dyna. Results obtained from the various simulations were compared, illustrating the advantages and disadvantages encountered during development.",
